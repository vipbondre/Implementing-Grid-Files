# Implementing-Grid-Files
We have implemented the functionalities of the Grid files which is used for the faster storage and retrieval of the spatial data in the secondary memory.       

The storage of spatial data points happens according to dynamically changing grid structure. 

The range query is also implemented to retrieve these spatial data points efficiently with the help of grid file.
